## Development Notes

**⚠️ Work in Progress notes:**

**Context:**

My previous implementation of fastcore.Transform was done by
reimplementing `fastcore.typedispatch.TypeDispatch` with an
implementation based on Plum.

It worked, with some minor breaking changes in fastai. But it wasn’t
simple enough.

In this notebook I re-build Transform from scratch directly using Plum.
The benefit will be that `fastcore.dispatch` can be removed. Users will
know to use Plum directly for typedispatch and see Transform as a tool
that builds on top of it. But at the cost of some more breaking changes.

**Plan in this notebook:**

I start with focusing on the `encode(s)` method. Right now I have two
implementations.

One simpler implementation, which ran into some complications with
global state if classes get redefined.

One more complicated implementation, using metaclasses. Which addresses
those issues.

I think now’s a good time to get some input again. Do you think I’m on
the right track? If so I’ll continue by adding more of the features
mentioned in Transform, i.e.:

- decodes and setups support
- implement return type casting (see note at the bottom of this notebook
  about that)
- transforms on tuples
- the classes in fastcore.transform that inherit from Transform
- Pipeline

**Open questions:**

- keep the initialization with enc=(f1,f2,f3) …?) etc.

## Pre-Release checklist

- [x] Init repo
- [x] Copy existing Transform implementation
- [x] Add Quantum tests
- [ ] Implement new Transform
- [ ] Implement new Pipeline
- [ ] Decide to remove pandas dev dependency (desired)
- [ ] See if can remove fastcore dependency (not desired per se)
- [ ] Add docs re plum and autoreload (see plum docs)
- [ ] pin plum to some greater than version
