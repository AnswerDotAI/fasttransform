As you can see in this example, a Transform will only be applied to a matching type, if a type is provided (otherwise it will always be applied). In the following code, the :int in the function signature means that f only gets applied to ints. That's why tfm(2.0) returns 2.0, but tfm(2) returns 3 here:"
